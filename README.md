# MealNetworks

Aims, hypotheses, methods, and an example network are provided in the document AIMS_METHODS_11_7.docx

Step-by-step food grouping.docx contains the detailed procedure of how foods were grouped and the food group keys.

To group, SAS programs should be run in the following order:
1. macros_for_foodgroup_coding_1_1.sas
2. foodgroup_coding_1_1.sas
3. foodgroup_coding_1_2.sas
4. foodgroup_coding_1_3.sas
5. foodgroup_coding_1_4.sas
6. foodgroup_coding_1_5.sas
7. foodgroup_coding_2_1.sas

### 5-fold cross validated glasso R code for regularized network (skeptic transformed) and Louvain communities/modules
- R code "meal network R code.R"
- in Python, code is networkX.ipynb 

### update on 11/7/2019
Will concentrate now just on HEI groups (T1 vs T3).
We will have 6 final graphs (2 for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, respectively)
